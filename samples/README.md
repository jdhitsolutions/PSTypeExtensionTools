# Samples

These files are intended to be used with Import-PSTypeextension. Save the file locally and run the Import command. You must specify the full file name with extension so the function knows how to import the data. Importing *will* overwrite any existing type members with the same name. The new type members will only last for the duration of your PowerShell session. If you always want a set of type extensions, put the Import-PSTypeExtension command into your PowerShel profile script.
